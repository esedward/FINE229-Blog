    In this project, I wanted to use the convergence of digital media to explore what defines art. The question “What is art?” has been an underlying theme in many ways for this course; from using non-traditional mediums to make art, such as gifs and glitches, to using a traditional medium in a non-traditional way for “moving still / still moving”, and finally, using a hybrid of digital mediums to remix a new medium for this final project.

    My piece starts with a very traditional form of art: a photograph of a pretty landscape. It may be unoriginal on its own, but it is unlikely that it would be disputed as art, even by untrained eyes. I started by intensely saturating the image so that more details could be brought out when I converted it to black and white. Once it was a black and white image, I laser printed it onto a piece of Masonite and then cut out the word “ART”. The piece is meant to be projected onto with the original saturated image, and the piece itself then projects the word “ART” on a blank canvas. I want to project the saturated image because the colours may not show up as clearly on the Masonite material. The idea is that the piece is art, in different mediums, from different angles. From one side, you will see the image of the landscape, but looking over the piece you would see the projected word “ART”.

    Oftentimes when artists explore the definition of art, they experiment in the abstract. They may produce pieces like blank canvases, which have value in the art world and in the theoretical, but aren’t accessible to the general public. Along with new mediums, the digital age has brought the democratization of art. For this reason, I wanted to make my piece extremely literal. It’s meaning is in your face without the need to search for it; the cutout acts as a label and projects “ART” into space. My piece labels its target as art without time for judgement.

    I was inspired by Madeline Churchill’s “Painting with Light in the Digital Age”. She discussed how artists can use new technologies to create painterly images. I wanted to get as close as possible to the literal sense of painting with light as I could while still stemming from a digital art form. I remixed a traditional landscape with light and a new medium allowed by the technology of laser printers. Remixability and theory exists everywhere in our culture, which is another reason why I wanted my piece to be easily accessible to anyone.

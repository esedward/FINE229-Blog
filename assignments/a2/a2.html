		To explain my experimentation process, I will first to talk about my interpretation of Glitch Art. Like Rosa Menkman said in Artifacts and Critical Media Aesthetics, glitch’s feel “perfectly imperfect”. The draw of Glitch Art is its bugs and “mistakes”. I was inspired by Sabato Visconti’s glitch work, which, to me, looks like an Instagram page gone wrong. I was drawn to working with images that was considered as, or aspired to, perfection. I worked with selfies, landscapes, children’s imagery, monuments, and other things that seemed at juxtaposition with the broken, almost creepy vibe, that gifts instigate. While traditional photography emphasizes photo quality and crispness, I also felt like Glitch Art was more welcoming of poor quality photos, whether they were taken by a phone or with bad lighting, since the goal was no longer perfection.

		I started with the text editor TextEdit, but quickly switched to working primarily in Audacity because I liked the more systematic approach I could take and the specific different effects I could apply. For this reason, I really appreciated the hacking approach that Nick Briz described in Glitch Codec Tutorial. In both programs, I played a lot with repetition by copy and pasting slices of the image into itself in a roughly even distribution (by eye). The stripes produced in many of my glitches are reminiscent of the imperfection of more analogue technologies from the past and is telling of the medium’s psychedelic roots, as discussed by Rosa Menkman in Art Geneologies. I also think it’s symbolic of an Instagram feed (or any social media) or a phone camera reel, which often feel like the same thing over and over: each selfie, or “perfect” image, though slightly different, feel exactly the same.

		One of my most successful results originated as a photograph of a red tulip that I took during Ottawa’s annual tulip festival. I was drawn to the innate beauty of the flower and it inspired me to try to recreate an artwork I did in high school where I had to duplicate, mirror, and flip a black and white film photograph manually with an enlarger and hand colour it with photo paints to make a kaleidoscope or mosaic effect. This project seemed to bring the former one into the modern technology era. I played with effects from Audacity that changed colour and created repetition. I also rotated the image to copy and paste some sections and then rotated it back in the end. This was to recreate some of the manual processes from the original work with glitches.

		I liked the effects on the flower but I wanted my approach to be more meaningful and less controlled to bring out more of the experimentation aspect of this project. For the Selfie glitch, I wanted to bring the Instagram inspiration more into play and chose effects that either sounded like a photo filter name or could be a reference to a beauty ideal. These included effects such as Normalize, Equalization with Bass Boost, Reverb with -5 Wet Gain, Distort with 100% Make-Up Gain, and Phaser. Some effects were applied to the whole image, like a filter, and some were only on sections to reference photo editing.

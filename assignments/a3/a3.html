    I was very interested in portraying the movement of water because it’s something that is always moving; it never stops. I took inspiration from stop motion, and how they use a sequence of images to “fake” movement. I wanted to give my piece a similar cinematic feel so I used sound. My piece takes the viewer through a variety of scenes with water, all moving at different paces. It starts slow and gradually gets faster and more powerful, then slows down again, simulating an arc. The sounds I used for this piece also come from a variety of sources, including rain, sewage drains, tap water, and a stream. I then mixed the sounds in Audacity and put them together to match the images at certain times.

    I wanted the viewer to get the feeling that they were taking a walk, which is why it starts in cities with man-made fountains, and then takes us into a forest, and returns. I also find the sound of water innately calming, even though it can be quite powerful and dangerous. This is another reason I chose to use different sounds that don’t necessarily come from the same source as what they were matched with.

    I approached this project with an image that conveyed movement because photography has been used to try and capture movement since its invention. I wanted to continue the tradition of capturing movement in stillness. I also thought it would be difficult to convey stillness in a video without being boring. My images form a sequence of sills that help the viewer feel like they are moving through them.
